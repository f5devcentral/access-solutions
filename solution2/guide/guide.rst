Solution 2 Policy
======================================================


Policy Walk-Through
----------------------

|image1|

#.  A user enters their credentials in the logon page agent.

    - Those credentials are collected, then stored as the default system session variables of session.logon.last.username and session.logon.last.password.
    - The user proceeds down the logon page fallback branch to the AD Auth Agent

#.  The AD Auth Agent validates the username and password session variables against the configured AD Domain Controller.
#.  If AD Authentication is successful, the user proceeds down the Successful Branch

    - The AD Query Agent connects to the AD Server to retrieve user attributes (Specifically memberOf)

#.  If the query succeeds, the user is assigned resourced defined in the AD Group Resource Assign
#.  The user is granted access via the Allow Terminal
#.  If the AD query fails,  the user is denied access via the Deny Terminal
#.  If AD Authentication is unsuccessful, the user proceeds down the fallback branch to the Deny Terminal


Policy Agent Configuration
----------------------------

The Logon Page contains only the default setting

|image2|

The AD Auth agent defines the AAA AD Servers that a user will be authenticated against.  All Setting are the default.

|image3|

The AD Query Agent uses the default settings to look for a sAMAccountName that matches  the session variable session.logon.last.username.

|image4|

If a match is found the attributes specified in the **Required Attributes** section are requested by APM and are returned by Active Directory

|image5|

The AD Group Resource Assign Agent grants user's access to resources according to their groups.

.. note:  Resource assignment is cumulative if a user is a member of more than one group.
