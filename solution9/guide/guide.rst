The Policy from a user's perspective
-------------------------------------

If the user attempts to access https://solution9.acme.com via postman located on the jumpbox they set to the Authorization server first for authentication(https://solution8.acme.com). Once authenticate the Post passes the JWT to https://api.acme.com  and JSON payload is presented.

This solution is designed to be integrated with other Authorization Server based solutions.
